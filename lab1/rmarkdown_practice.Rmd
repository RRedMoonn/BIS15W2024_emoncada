### Creating Objects

```{r}
x <- c(1,9,9,0,2,3)
```

```{r}
y <- c(2,0,1,2,3,11)
```


### Practicing Various Arithmetic Functions

```{r}
x+y
```
 
```{r}
x-y
```
 
```{r}
x*y
```

```{r}
x/y
```

 
Adding the two objects is done per variable number, meaning the first number of the first object will be added to th first number of the second object. Similarly done with subtraction, multiplication and division.

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
gplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_bar()
```
