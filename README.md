Hello! This repository includes my completed homework and lab assignments completed during the BIS 15L course for Winter 2024.

## A Little Bit About Me

I am a 5th year Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior student at UC Davis. This is my last quarter before I graduate! I am pursuing a clinical research path and hope to use the coding knowledge I learn in this class into my future profession.
