# Eva's BIS 15L Repository

Hello! This repository includes my homework and lab assignments completed during the BIS 15L course for Winter 2024.

My homework is stored in the folder named "homework".

## A Little Bit About Me

I am a 5th year Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior student at UC Davis. This is my last quarter before I graduate! I am pursuing a clinical research path and hope to use the coding knowledge I learn in this class in my future profession.
