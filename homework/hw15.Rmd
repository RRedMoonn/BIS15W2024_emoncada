## Instructions
This homework is a bit less traditional this week. There are some errors in the code below. In addition add notes and titles to the code chunks that explains what the code chunck does. Use AI tools, notes from class, or any other resources to help fix the errors. Feel free to edit any plots to your preference. Don't forget to answer the two questions at the bottom. Upon completion, you should not have to '#' out any of the code chunks.

Push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.   

Again make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!

1.
```{r}

    Age >= 40 & Age <= 49 ~ "40s",
    Age >= 50 & Age <= 59 ~ "50s",
    Age >= 60 ~ "60s")) # Combine 70s with 60s

head(grouped_bc)
```

8.

```
9. What are two drawbacks and two benefits of AI?
Two benefits of AI include enhanced efficiency through automation and improved decision-making through data analysis. Drawbacks include the potential for job displacement due to automation and ethical concerns surrounding data privacy and biases in algorithms.

10. Do you think you will use AI for coding in the future? Why or why not?
I might for some troubleshooting or if I have to input a lot of the same code into similar questions to use my time more efficiently. I am thinking in terms of using it at my future job. At the end of th day, I would most likely utilize my own knowledge and use AI as a support/ help with smaller issues.

## Push your final code to GitHub!
Please be sure that you check the `keep md` file in the knit preferences.
